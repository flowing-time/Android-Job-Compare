# Job Comparison Application Team 138



## Getting Started

<p>The job comparison application, available exclusively for android, is an application that will allow you to store <br>
and compare job offers. Please note that for optimal experience that reflects the original design intention, we require the system to be run on a Pixel 3 (larger screen surface).

The application will keep track of your current job, and will let you add any number of job offers and compare 
<br>them based off salary, leave time, remote work days, and the bonus payment. 

You can adjust the weights of each of these criteria, allowing you to put more weight into what you think is a better benefit!</p>



## Main Menu
